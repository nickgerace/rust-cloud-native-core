## What are the goals of this organization?

Rust Cloud Native is focused on strictly one goal: **enabling the usage of Rust in the "Cloud", which refers to software related to infrastructure, containers, and Kubernetes.**

In the future, our organization may formalize a secondary goal to create an official [Rust working group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance).
For now, we are focused on our aforementioned goal with the intent to provide a home for folks interested in cloud native Rust.

## Owners and Members

One of our first organizational objectives is to create a formal owners and members group with full access to the organization and its contents.
Humans do not scale, and Rust Cloud Native is for everyone.
The process to welcoming more members is still to be determined.

## What can I do to help?

File issues, pull requests, and particpate in discussions (coming soon) in the organization's repositories.
This organization is our community's canvas.
Let's paint it.
