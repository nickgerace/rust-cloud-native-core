## What are the goals of this organization?

Rust Cloud Native is focused on strictly one goal: **enabling the usage of Rust in the "Cloud", which refers to software related to infrastructure, containers, and Kubernetes.**

In the future, our organization may formalize a secondary goal to create an official [Rust working group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance).
For now, we are focused on our aforementioned goal with the intent to provide a home for folks interested in cloud native Rust.

## What should I know when navigating repositories under this organization?

This section has been divided by topic.

## Who are the owners?

For now, [@nickgerace](https://github.com/nickgerace) is the sole owner and maintainer of this organization and its repositories.
One of the first organizational objectives is to create a formal `OWNERS` group with full access to the organization and its contents.
Humans do not scale, and Rust Cloud Native is for everyone!

## What can I do to help?

File issues, pull requests, and particpate in discussions (coming soon) in the organization's repositories.
This organization is our community's canvas.
Let's paint it.
